Design Patterns for Object Oriented Programming

There is a three groups of Object Oriented Design Patterns according to its function.

These groups are:

* Creational Patterns: Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system
independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance 
to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

|Design Pattern|Description|
|---|---|
|Abstract Factory|Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.|
|Builder|Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.|
|Factory Method|Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.|
|Prototype|Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.|
|Singleton|Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point ofaccess to it.|

* Structural Patterns: are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

|Design Pattern|Description|
|---|---|
|Adapter|Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.|

* Behavioral Patterns: there is not a concrete scope for this group. These Patterns
implement the logic for some sort of manipulation that we want to do with an object.
